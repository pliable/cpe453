Steve Choo (schoo)
Kevin Stein (kestein)

Simply run "make" to make all, or "make example" to produce the example program, and "make mond"
to produce mond.

CLI parsing:
   Stein will do 1-3 (launch pthread shit)
   Choo will do 4-8

slap mutex locks/releases before all writes

to do still:
  create pthread
  pthread -(cleanup || cancel)
  pick which mutex thang todo
  fuck...dammit, something here too
